WikiWhiz – Learn Smarter with Wikipedia-Powered Quizzes
Welcome to Quizipedia, your personal trivia companion that transforms Wikipedia content into interactive quizzes! Designed during the WikiVerse Hackathon at IIIT-Hyderabad, Quizipedia makes learning fun, fast, and fact-based — perfect for students, trivia enthusiasts, and lifelong learners.


Project Overview
Quizipedia leverages the vast knowledge base of Wikipedia APIs to generate dynamic multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on various topics like science, history, and art. Instead of passively reading articles, users can now actively engage with knowledge through gamified quizzes.


Problem Statement
While Wikipedia holds a wealth of educational information, it's mostly consumed passively. There is a lack of engaging, interactive ways for users—especially students—to test and retain what they learn. Quizipedia aims to change that by offering a trivia platform that taps into Wikipedia’s open knowledge network.


Features

Randomized multiple-choice answers (MCQs)
